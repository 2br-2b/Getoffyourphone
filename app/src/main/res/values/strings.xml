    <string name="drawer_item2_dialog_message">General Info:\n\n1- You CANNOT lock apps without selecting a timer\n2- You CAN lock apps without selecting App-Open Counter\n3- App will close when you confirm lock down and a notification will show up\n4- You can dismiss the notification, and a "Timer Finished" notification will show when the lock-down is done\n\n______\n\n-Select Desired Time:\nThis option is where the magic happens, you select the desired time, which will be the duration of apps lock-down. After you select this, you cannot change it until lock-down is done. Please do not force close the app or you will have to clear app data.\n\n-Select Desired Counter:\nThis option is related to how many times you open the locked apps. All you have to do is select an option, every time you bypass the selected value, the Lock Screen ( screen that opens when you launch a locked app ) will change. I made 4 lock screens, each with a different GIF and text that will somehow, make you feel ashamed for passing the limit. You CANNOT change this after starting the lock-down, until it finishes.\n\nThat\'s all ! if you have any issues or concerns please don't hesitate to use the built-in issue reporter. Enjoy !</string>
